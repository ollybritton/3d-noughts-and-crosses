#Â `3d-noughts-and-crosses`
This is the source code for the "3D Noughts and Crosses" website, which you can try out [here](https://projects.ollybritton.com/3d-noughts-and-crosses).

The source code is quite messy. If I were to do this again, I'd use React and not have as many global variables so that the code actually makes sense, rather than being a tangled web of functions all mutating the same variable. I wouldn't be surprised if [it contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule).
