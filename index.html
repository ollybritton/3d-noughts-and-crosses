            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" class="link blue">Noughts and
                    Crosses</a>, or Tic-Tac-Toe, is the famous game about getting three \(X\)s or
                \(O\)s in a
                row. This website demonstrates a variant where you play in 3D, trying to get a line through a cube where
                each grid represents a layer.
            </p>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                By default, the AI is a bit stupid. That's because it becomes possible for the first player to force a
                win if they take the center square. The AI will realise this if you put its depth limit to roughly 8, so
                it becomes quite difficult to win after that point, unless you go first.
            </p>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                The algorithm used for the AI is <a class="link blue"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves">minimax</a> with
                <a class="link blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta
                    pruning</a>. This algorithm recursively considers all possible moves it could make and all possible
                responses to
                its moves so that it can pick one that it expects to maximise its chances of winning. Without alpha-beta
                pruning, it becomes computationally intractable much faster than it would otherwise. Since there's 27
                possible moves at the start, thinking ten moves ahead without any special tricks requires considering
                \(27 \times 26
                \times 25 \ldots \times 18 \times 17\) or \(520,431,047,136,000\) possibilities.
            </p>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                If each possible game took \(1\text{ns}\) to consider, this technique means the algorithm
                would
                finish running in 6 days. Alpha-beta pruning means you can vastly cut down on the amount of
                options you have to consider by "pruning" states that you know won't lead to anything as good as what
                you've found so far. The number of states pruned is displayed in the information section.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt3 mb2 lh-copy">Controls</h3>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                To begin playing, just click on any of the squares on the right-hand side, or scroll down if you're on
                mobile. By default, the AI will automatically respond to your moves. To turn this off, toggle the
                "Automatically respond to player moves" checkbox. You can also force the AI to make the next move for
                the current player by clicking the "Play next move" button. "Analyse" will have the AI look for all
                possible moves, but not make any and instead report the information finds in the "Information" section.
            </p>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                The slider at the top controls how many <a class="link blue"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ply_(game_theory)">plys</a> the AI will look ahead. One "ply" is
                one move by any
                player, a term used to avoid the ambiguity that comes with just saying "moves". The default is 6 and is
                reasonably easy to win against. Lowering the slider will make the AI worse but faster at making moves,
                and increasing the slider will make the AI better but much, much slower. Each successive notch on the
                slider corresponds to roughly a \(10 \times\) increase in waiting time.
            </p>

            <p class="mt0 lh-copy">
                You can see a heatmap of what the AI thinks are good moves and bad moves by toggling the "Show a heatmap
                of predicted wins/losses" checkbox. This won't have any affect until you're a few moves into the game,
                as the AI can't see far ahead enough into the future to decide whether a mood is good or bad. Once it
                does, it will color each box depending on if there's a big chance for \(X\) or a big chance for \(O\).

                Finally, there is also the "Optimise for game length" option. This makes the AI try to avoid moves that
                will bring the game to an end, to see how long it's possible to go without anybody winning, including
                itself. It's interesting to watch it play against itself and see which player ends up making the move
                that wins the game.

                        tic-tac-toe</a>
                    is where you try to avoid winning, force your
                    opponent to get three in a row before you do. You can always win or draw if you go first by playing
                    in the middle square and then mirroring your opponent's moves.

                        tic-tac-toe</a> is a variant where moves are "quantum superpositions" of normal tic-tac-toe
                    moves. Moves can be in two places at once until a cycle is formed, where the system is then
                    "observed" and the game is forced into one definite state. It was invented as a way to explore the
                    intuition behind quantum mechanics without any
                    mathematics.

                        tic-tac-toe/number scrabble</a> is a game mathematically equivalent to standard noughts and
                    crosses where two
                    players take turns naming numbers from 1 to 9, where you can't repeat numbers that have already been
                    said. The first player who says any three numbers that sum to 15 wins. Because you can arrange the
                    numbers on a 3 by 3 magic square, the game is isomorphic to tic-tac-toe.

                    lets either player decide whether to use a \(X\) or a \(O\) on their turn.

                    played on any sized \(N \times N\) grid. Players can use either an "S" or an "O" on their turn and
                    the aim is to get as many sequences of "SOS" horizontally, vertically or diagonally as they can
                    before the grid is full.

                    the
                    least interesting variant you could imagine. It's like noughts and crosses, but you play in a
                    \(1\times
                    N\) grid and everyone is \(X\). The first one to get three in a row wins.
